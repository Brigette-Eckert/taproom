# TapRoom

## About 

An inventory tracking app for a  fake pub built with Angular 2 as part of self study following Epicodus curriculum.

## What I learned from this project:


 * Practiced using Angular 2 and Angular Cli
 
* Praticed using google materialize  

## User Stories

* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent

* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list.

* As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.

* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).

* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
